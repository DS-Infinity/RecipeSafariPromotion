## How it works?

- Website will have categories for popular food items. For example, Ice cream, Pizza, burgers, Pasta, etc. are generated automatically with help of Artificial Intelligence so that users can find awesome recipes to make and share their customizations.
- Tags (like hashes on Instagram) for indicating flavor of the recipe dish and ease of sorting while searching.
- Users can create new recipes and get feedback and discuss using comments and forums.
- The website also provides the option to edit recipes.
- Text to speech with speed control for each recipe.
- Feedbacks and reviews can contain images, videos, suggestions, and a mandatory star rating.
- Users can also bookmark favorite recipes to access them easily next time.
- A concept of a recipe of the day is also introduced (based on Artificial Intelligence) to show the recipe with the best ratings on top for straight 24 hours.
- Just before starting to prepare something awesome, the website also shows the list of ingredients along with their buy-now link, in case you're out of stock for that item.
- The website will be fully responsive with mobile devices for the best experience.
